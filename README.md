### Why and how:

-   This project was initiated by me and a good friend of mine as our final product for the seminar course:<br/>
    [computer science & data security (DE)](https://fwg.dahme-spreewald.info/fw/Fachschaften/Technik/Informatik/30549.html)

-   the main focus of our classes were and are data security and programming, specifically [python](https://www.python.org/)

-   me and my friend, we decided to make a restapi using flask and a frontend using native webdevtools (html, css, js) in form of a website

-   this project is intended to be used as a simple, easy to use and maintain tool for educational purposes

### How to use/clone for yourself:

-   install python3.9
    (watch tutorials on how to, don't forget to add python to the path and don't forget to install pip)

-   install flask
    `pip install flask`

-   clone the repo
    (`git clone https://github.com/xNaCly/semikurs-code.git` if you don't have git installed just download the repo as a zip)

-   go to the backend directory and open cmd/powershell in it

-   execute `python3 flask_app.py`
    (the restapi is now up and running)

-   navigate to frontend/index.html

-   double click or drag into your browser and voilà, choose or loose is working
