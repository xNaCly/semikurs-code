### Why and how:
-   This project was initiated by me and a good friend of mine as our final product for the seminar course:<br/>
    [computer science & data security (DE)](https://fwg.dahme-spreewald.info/fw/Fachschaften/Technik/Informatik/30549.html)

-   the main focus of our classes were and are data security and programming, specifically [python](https://www.python.org/)

-   me and my friend, we decided to make a restapi using flask and a frontend using native webdevtools (html, css, js) in form of a website

-   this project is intended to be used as a simple, easy to use and maintain tool for educational purposes

###  futureplans:
- [ ] add understandable docs
- [x] add german and english readme & docs
- [ ] record a video showing features and installion-process
