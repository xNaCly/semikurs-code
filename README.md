# semikurs-code

### Why and how:
- This project was initiated by me and a good friend of mine as our final product for the seminar course:<br/>
[computer science & data security (DE)](https://fwg.dahme-spreewald.info/fw/Fachschaften/Technik/Informatik/30549.html)

- the main focus of our classes were and are Date security and programming, specifically [python](https://www.python.org/)

- me and my friend, we decided to make a restapi using flask and a frontend using native webdevtools (html, css, js) in form of a website

- this project is intended to be used as a simple, easy to use and maintain tool for educational purposes

### How to use/clone for yourself:
- install python3.9 
  (watch tutorials on how to, don't forget to add python to the path and don't forget to install pip)
  
- install flask
`pip install flask`

- clone the repo 
  (`git clone https://github.com/xNaCly/semikurs-code.git` if you don't have git installed just download the repo as a zip)
  
- go to the backend directory and open cmd/powershell in it

- execute `python3 flask_app.py` 
  (the restapi is now up and running)
  
- navigate to frontend/index.html

- double click or drag into your browser and voil√†, choose or loose is working
